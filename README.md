## Introduction
Welcome to the Student App, a mobile application that allows you to view list of students based on ReqRes API.

## About the Project
The UserApp mobile app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. In this pattern, the user interface components, like activities, observe real-time data updates from the view model. The view model retrieves the observed data from the data source layer, which consists of the model and repository. The data source layer serves as a connection between the API responses and the presentation layer (view and view model), enabling smooth data access for users.

## Mobile Tech Stack
The UserApp mobile app is built using the following technologies:

- Android Studio: The official IDE for Android app development.
- Kotlin Programming Language: A modern programming language for developing Android apps.
- Paging3: A library for efficient paging of data in the app.
- Datastore: A data storage solution for managing app preferences and settings.
- Jetpack Library:
  - Lifecycle: Provides lifecycle-aware components for managing Android app lifecycle.
  - UI: Offers UI components and tools for creating a polished app interface.
  - Data: Provides components for working with data, including LiveData and ViewModel.
- Retrofit2: A type-safe HTTP client for making API requests.
- Glide: A powerful image loading and caching library for displaying fruit images in the app.
- Lottie: An animation library for adding visually appealing animations to the app.
